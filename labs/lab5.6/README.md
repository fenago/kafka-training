# Lab 5.6: Kafka Retry, in-flight, request timeout, and retry backoff

Welcome to the session 5 lab 6. The work for this lab is done in `~/kafka-training/lab5.6`.
In this lab, you are going to set up Kafka Producer retries.





## Lab Adding Retries and Timeouts

In this lab we set up timeouts, set up retries, set up retry back off and change
inflight messages to 1 so retries donâ€™t store records out of order.


## Change it and then run it

As before startup ZooKeeper if needed and three Kafka brokers. Then we will modify
StockPriceKafkaProducer to configure retry, timeouts, in-flight message count and retry back
off.  We will run the StockPriceKafkaProducer. While we start and stop any two different
Kafka Brokers while StockPriceKafkaProducer runs. Please notice retry messages in log of
StockPriceKafkaProducer.




#### ~/kafka-training/lab5.6/src/main/java/com/fenago/kafka/producer/StockPriceKafkaProducer.java
#### Kafka Producer:  StockPriceKafkaProducer disable batching
```java

public class StockPriceKafkaProducer {

    private static Producer<String, StockPrice>
                                    createProducer() {
        final Properties props = new Properties();
        setupBootstrapAndSerializers(props);
        setupBatchingAndCompression(props);
        setupRetriesInFlightTimeout(props);

        return new KafkaProducer<>(props);
    }
    ...
    private static void setupRetriesInFlightTimeout(Properties props) {
        //Only two in-flight messages per Kafka broker connection
        // - max.in.flight.requests.per.connection (default 5)
        props.put(ProducerConfig.MAX_IN_FLIGHT_REQUESTS_PER_CONNECTION,
                1);
        //Set the number of retries - retries
        props.put(ProducerConfig.RETRIES_CONFIG, 3);

        //Request timeout - request.timeout.ms
        props.put(ProducerConfig.REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS_CONFIG, 15_000);

        //Only retry after one second.
        props.put(ProducerConfig.RETRY_BACKOFF_MS_CONFIG, 1_000);
    }
    ...
}
```

The above configures Producer retry, timeouts, in-flight message count and retry back off.


## Expected output after 2 broker shutdown

Run all brokers and then kill any two servers. Look for retry messages in the Producer log.
Restart brokers and see the Producer recover. Also use replica verification to see when the
broker catches up.


## ***ACTION*** - EDIT StockPriceKafkaProducer and finish the setupRetriesInFlightTimeout using instructions in the file.
## ***ACTION*** - START Kafka Brokers and ZooKeeper if needed.
## ***ACTION*** - Run StockPriceKafkaProducer from the IDE.
## ***ACTION*** - Run SimpleStockPriceConsumer from the IDE.
## ***ACTION*** - KILL one Kafka Broker while StockPriceKafkaProducer is running.
## ***ACTION*** - KILL two Kafka Broker while StockPriceKafkaProducer is running.



## WARN Inflight Message Count

The MAX_IN_FLIGHT_REQUESTS_PER_CONNECTION is the max number of unacknowledged requests that a
client can send on a single connection before blocking
If  >1 and failed sends, then there is a risk of message re-ordering on partition during
retry attempt (they could be written out of order of the send). If this is bad, depends on use
but for our StockPrices this is not good, you should pick retries > 1 or inflight > 1 but not
both. Avoid duplicates. The June 2017 release fixed this with sequence from producer.
