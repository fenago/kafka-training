# Lab 7.1: Avro

Welcome to the session 7 lab 1. The work for this lab is done in `~/kafka-training/labs/lab7.1`. In this lab, you are going to use Avro.





## Avro Introduction for Big Data and Data Streaming Architectures

Apache Avro™ is a data serialization system.
Avro provides data structures, binary data format, container file format to
store persistent data, and provides RPC capabilities. Avro does not require
code generation to use and integrates well with JavaScript, Python, Ruby, C, C#, C++ and Java.
Avro gets used in the *Hadoop ecosystem* as well as by *Kafka*.

Avro is similar to Thrift, Protocol Buffers, JSON, etc. Avro does not require
code generation. Avro needs less encoding as part of the data since it stores
names and types in the schema reducing duplication. Avro supports the evolution
of schemas.

## Why Avro for Kafka and Hadoop?

Avro supports direct mapping to JSON as well as a compact binary format.
It is a very fast serialization format. Avro is widely used in the Hadoop ecosystem.
Avro supports polyglot bindings to many programming languages and a code generation
for static languages. For dynamically typed languages, code generation is not needed.
Another key advantage of Avro is its support of evolutionary schemas which supports
compatibility checks, and allows evolving your data over time.

Avro supports platforms like Kafka that has multiple Producers and Consumers which evolve over
time. Avro schemas help keep your data clean and robust.

There was a trend towards schema-less as part of the NoSQL, but that pendulum has swung back a bit
e.g., Cassandra has schemas REST/JSON was schema-less and IDL-less but not anymore with Swagger,
API gateways, and RAML. Now the trend is more towards schemas that can evolve and Avro fits
well in this space.

### Avro Schema provides Future Proof Robustness
Streaming architecture like Kafka supports decoupling by sending data in streams to an unknown number of consumers.
Streaming architecture is challenging as Consumers and Producers evolve on different timelines.
Producers send a stream of records that zero to many Consumers read.  Not only are
there multiple consumers but data might end up in Hadoop or some other store
and used for use cases you did not even imagine. Schemas help future proof your data and make
it more robust. Supporting all use cases future (Big Data), past (older Consumers) and
current use cases is not easy without a schema. Avro schema with its support for
evolution is essential for making the data robust for streaming architectures like Kafka,
and with the metadata that schema provides, you can reason on the data.  Having a schema
provides robustness in providing meta-data about the data stored in Avro records which
are self-documenting the data.

### Avro provides future usability of data
Data record format compatibility is a hard problem to solve with streaming architecture
and Big Data. Avro schemas are not a cure-all, but essential for documenting and modeling
your data. Avro Schema definitions capture a point in time of what your data looked like when
it recorded since the schema is saved with the data. Data will evolve. New fields are added.
Since streams often get recorded in data lakes like Hadoop and those records can represent
historical data, not operational data, it makes sense that data streams and data lakes have a
less rigid, more evolving schema than the schema of the operational relational database or
Cassandra cluster.  It makes sense to have a rigid schema for operational data, but not
data that ends up in a data lake.

With a streaming platform, consumers and producers can change all of the time and evolve
quite a bit. Producers can have Consumers that they never know. You can’t test a Consumer
that you don’t know. For agility sakes, you don’t want to update every Consumer every time
a Producers adds a field to a Record. These types of updates are not feasible without
support for Schema.


## Avro Schema
Avro data format (wire format and file format) is defined by Avro schemas.
When deserializing data, the schema is used. Data is serialized based on the schema,
and schema is sent with data or in the case of files stored with the data.
Avro data plus schema is fully self-describing data format.

When Avro files store data it also stores schema. Avro RPC is also based on schema,
and IDL. Part of the RPC protocol exchanges schemas as part of the handshake.
Avro schemas and IDL are written in JSON.

Let's take a look at an example Avro schema.

#### ./src/main/avro/com/fenago/phonebook/Employee.avsc
#### Example schema for an Employee record

```javascript
{"namespace": "com.fenago.phonebook",
  "type": "record",  "name": "Employee",
    "fields": [
        {"name": "firstName", "type": "string"},
        {"name": "lastName", "type": "string"},
        {"name": "age",  "type": "int"},
        {"name": "phoneNumber",  "type": "string"}
    ]
}
```

The above defines an employee record with firstName, lastName, age and phoneNumber.


***ACTION*** - EDIT Employee.avsc and modify it to match the above code listing.


## Avro schema generation tools

Avro comes with a set of tools for generating Java classes for Avro types that you
define in Avro schema. There are plugins for Maven and Gradle to generate code based
on Avro schemas.

This `gradle-avro-plugin` is a Gradle plugin that uses Avro tools to do Java code generation
for Apache Avro.
This plugin supports Avro schema files (`.avsc`), and Avro RPC IDL (`.avdl`).
For Kafka Training Course, Instructor led, onsite training")
you only need `avsc` schema files.

#### build.gradle - example using gradle-avro-plugin

```java
plugins {
    id "com.commercehub.gradle.plugin.avro" version "0.9.0"
}

group 'fenago'
version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'
apply plugin: 'java'
sourceCompatibility = 1.8

dependencies {
    compile "org.apache.avro:avro:1.8.1"
    testCompile group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.11'
}

repositories {
    jcenter()
    mavenCentral()
}

avro {
    createSetters = false
    fieldVisibility = "PRIVATE"
}
```


***ACTION*** - EDIT build.gradle and follow the instructions in the file.

Notice that we did not generate setter methods, and we made the fields private.
This makes the instances somewhat immutable.

Running `gradle build` will generate the Employee.java.

#### ./build/generated-main-avro-java/com/fenago/phonebook/Employee.java
#### Generated Avro code

```java

package com.fenago.phonebook;

import org.apache.avro.specific.SpecificData;

@SuppressWarnings("all")
@org.apache.avro.specific.AvroGenerated
public class Employee extends org.apache.avro.specific.SpecificRecordBase implements org.apache.avro.specific.SpecificRecord {
  private static final long serialVersionUID = -6112285611684054927L;
  public static final org.apache.avro.Schema SCHEMA$ = new
                        org.apache.avro.Schema.Parser().parse("{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"Employee\"...");
  public static org.apache.avro.Schema getClassSchema() { return SCHEMA$; }
  private java.lang.String firstName;
  private java.lang.String lastName;
  private int age;
  private java.lang.String phoneNumber;
  ...

```


***ACTION*** - RUN `gradle build` from the project folder

The gradle plugin calls the Avro utilities which generates the files and puts them under
`build/generated-main-avro-java`

Let's use the generated class as follows to construct an Employee instance.



#### Using the new Employee class

```java
Employee bob = Employee.newBuilder().setAge(35)
        .setFirstName("Bob")
        .setLastName("Jones")
        .setPhoneNumber("555-555-1212")
        .build();

assertEquals("Bob", bob.getFirstName());

```

The Employee class has a constructor and has a builder.
We can use the builder to build a new Employee instance.


Next we want to write the Employees to disk.

#### Writing a list of employees to an Avro file

```java
final List<Employee> employeeList = ...
final DatumWriter<Employee> datumWriter = new SpecificDatumWriter<>(Employee.class);
final DataFileWriter<Employee> dataFileWriter = new DataFileWriter<>(datumWriter);

try {
    dataFileWriter.create(employeeList.get(0).getSchema(),
            new File("employees.avro"));
    employeeList.forEach(employee -> {
        try {
            dataFileWriter.append(employee);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }

    });
} finally {
    dataFileWriter.close();
}

```

The above shows serializing an Employee list to disk. In Kafka, we will not be writing to
disk directly. We are just showing how so you have a way to test Avro serialization, which
is helpful when debugging schema incompatibilities. Note we create a `DatumWriter`, which
converts Java instance into an in-memory serialized format. `SpecificDatumWriter` is used
with generated classes like Employee. `DataFileWriter` writes the serialized records to
the `employee.avro` file.

Now let's demonstrate how to read data from an Avro file.

#### Reading a list of employees from an avro file

```java
final File file = new File("employees.avro");
final List<Employee> employeeList = new ArrayList<>();
final DatumReader<Employee> empReader = new SpecificDatumReader<>(Employee.class);
final DataFileReader<Employee> dataFileReader = new DataFileReader<>(file, empReader);

while (dataFileReader.hasNext()) {
    employeeList.add(dataFileReader.next(new Employee()));
}

```

The above deserializes employees from the `employees.avro` file into a `java.util.List` of
Employee instances. Deserializing is similar to serializing but in reverse. We create a
`SpecificDatumReader` to converts in-memory serialized items into instances of our generated
`Employee` class. The `DatumReader` reads records from the file by calling next.
Another way to read is using forEach as follows:


#### Reading a list of employees from an avro file using forEach
```java
final DataFileReader<Employee> dataFileReader = new DataFileReader<>(file, empReader);
dataFileReader.forEach(employeeList::add);
```



***ACTION*** - EDIT `src/test/java/com/fenago/phonebook/EmployeeTest.java` and follow the instructions in the file.

***ACTION*** - RUN EmployeeTest from the IDE

## Working with Generic Records

You can use a `GenericRecord` instead of generating an Employee class as follows.

#### Using GenericRecord to create an Employee record

```java
final String schemaLoc = "src/main/avro/com/fenago/phonebook/Employee.avsc";
final File schemaFile = new File(schemaLoc);
final Schema schema = new Schema.Parser().parse(schemaFile);

GenericRecord bob = new GenericData.Record(schema);
bob.put("firstName", "Bob");
bob.put("lastName", "Smith");
bob.put("age", 35);
assertEquals("Bob", bob.get("firstName"));
```

You can write to Avro files using GenericRecords as well.


#### Writing GenericRecords to an Avro file

```java
final List<GenericRecord> employeeList = new ArrayList<>();


final DatumWriter<GenericRecord> datumWriter = new GenericDatumWriter<>(schema);
final DataFileWriter<GenericRecord> dataFileWriter = new DataFileWriter<>(datumWriter);

try {
    dataFileWriter.create(employeeList.get(0).getSchema(),
            new File("employees2.avro"));
    employeeList.forEach(employee -> {
        try {
            dataFileWriter.append(employee);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    });
} finally {
    dataFileWriter.close();
}
```



You can read from Avro files using `GenericRecord`s as well.


#### Reading GenericRecords from an Avro file
```java
final File file = new File("employees2.avro");
final List<GenericRecord> employeeList = new ArrayList<>();
final DatumReader<GenericRecord> empReader = new GenericDatumReader<>();
final DataFileReader<GenericRecord> dataFileReader = new DataFileReader<>(file, empReader);

while (dataFileReader.hasNext()) {
    employeeList.add(dataFileReader.next(null));
}

employeeList.forEach(System.out::println);

```

Avro will validate the data types when it serializes and deserializes the data.

#### Using the wrong type

```java
GenericRecord employee = new GenericData.Record(schema);
employee.put("firstName", "Bob" + index);
employee.put("lastName", "Smith"+ index);
//employee.put("age", index % 35 + 25);
employee.put("age", "OLD");
```

#### Stack trace from above
```

```

In the Avro schema, you can define Records, Arrays, Enums, Unions, Maps and you can use primitive types like  String, Int, Boolean, Decimal, Timestamp, Date, and more.

The [Avro schema and IDL specification document](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#Protocol+Declaration) describes all of the supported types.

 Let's add to the Employee schema and show some of the different types that Avro supports.


***ACTION*** - EDIT `src/test/java/com/fenago/phonebook/EmployeeTestNoGen.java` and follow the instructions in the file.

***ACTION*** - RUN EmployeeTestNoGen from the IDE

***ACTION*** - CHANGE Change a test and leave out the firstName what happens?

***ACTION*** - CHANGE Change a test and use a string for age what happens?


## Working with more advanced schema

#### More advanced schema - `src/main/avro/com/fenago/phonebook/Employee.avsc`
 ```javascript
 {"namespace": "com.fenago.phonebook",
  "type": "record",
  "name": "Employee",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "firstName", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "nickName", "type": ["null", "string"], "default" : null},
    {"name": "lastName", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "age",  "type": "int"},
    {"name": "emails", "default":[], "type":{"type": "array", "items": "string"}},
    {"name": "phoneNumber",  "type":
      [ "null",
        { "type": "record",   "name": "PhoneNumber",
        "fields": [
          {"name": "areaCode", "type": "string"},
          {"name": "countryCode", "type": "string", "default" : ""},
          {"name": "prefix", "type": "string"},
          {"name": "number", "type": "string"}
        ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {"name":"status", "default" :"SALARY", "type": { "type": "enum", "name": "Status",
              "symbols" : ["RETIRED", "SALARY", "HOURLY", "PART_TIME"]}
    }
  ]
}
```


***ACTION*** - EDIT Employee.avsc and modify it to match the above code listing.

***ACTION*** - RUN gradle build again to generate classes

Avro record attributes are as follows:

* name:  name of the record (required).
* namespace: equates to packages or modules
* doc: documentation for future user of this schema
* aliases:  array aliases (alias names)
* fields:  an array of fields

Avro field attributes are as follows:

* name:  name of the field (required)
* doc: description of field (important for future usage)
* type:  JSON object defining a schema, or a JSON string naming a record definition (required)
* default: Default value for this field
* order: specifies sort ordering of record (optional, ascending, descending, ignore)
 * aliases: array of alternate names

The `doc` attribute is imperative for future usage as it documents what the fields and
records are supposed to represent. Remember that this data can outlive systems that
produced it. A self-documenting schema is critical for a robust system.

The above has examples of default values, arrays, primitive types, Records within records,
enums, and more.

The PhoneNumber object gets generated as does the Status class.

#### PhoneNumber record
```java

package com.fenago.phonebook;

import org.apache.avro.specific.SpecificData;

@SuppressWarnings("all")
@org.apache.avro.specific.AvroGenerated
public class PhoneNumber extends org.apache.avro.specific.SpecificRecordBase ...{
  private static final long serialVersionUID = -3138777939618426199L;
  public static final org.apache.avro.Schema SCHEMA$ =
                   new org.apache.avro.Schema.Parser().parse("{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":...
  public static org.apache.avro.Schema getClassSchema() { return SCHEMA$; }
   private java.lang.String areaCode;
   private java.lang.String countryCode;
   private java.lang.String prefix;
   private java.lang.String number;

```

#### Status enum
```java
package com.fenago.phonebook;
@SuppressWarnings("all")
@org.apache.avro.specific.AvroGenerated
public enum Status {
  RETIRED, SALARY, HOURLY, PART_TIME  ;
  ...
```


***ACTION*** - MODIFY Using solution and slides as a guide modify unit tests to use Status and PhoneNumber. Then run tests.


#### Tips for using Avro with Kafka and Hadoop

Avoid advanced Avro features which are not supported by polyglot language mappings.
Think simple data transfer objects or structs. Don't use magic strings,  use enums
instead as they provide better validation.

Document all records and fields in the schema.
Documentation is imperative for future usage. Documents what the fields and records
represent.  A self-documenting schema is critical for a robust streaming system and Big Data.
Don't use complex union types. Use Unions for nullable fields only and avoid using
recursive types at all costs.

Use reasonable field names and use them consistently with other records. Example,
`employee_id` instead of `id` and then use `employee_id` in all other records that
have a field that refer to the `employee_id` from Employee.


## Conclusion

Avro provides fast, compact data serialization. It supports data structures like Records, Maps, Array, and basic types.
You can use it direct or use Code Generation.
Avro allows schema support to Kafka which we will demonstrate in another article.
